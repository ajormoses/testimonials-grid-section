[Overview](#overview)
     My name is Ajor Moses, i'm new on this platform and i'm open to learning and improvement, Thanks for checking out my front-end coding challenge.
     [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.
    **To do this challenge, you need a strong understanding of HTML and CSS GRID**

  - [The challenge](#the-challenge)
    My challenge is to build up this feature illustration using HTML & CSS and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
    The only assets we provide in this challenge are provided in the image folder. You need to create everything else using HTML & CSS!

  - [Screenshot](#screenshot)
    You will find all the required assets in the `/images` and `/design` folder. The assets are already optimized.

- [My process](#my-process)
    1. I started by looking through the designs to start planning out how i will tackle the project. 
    2. Before adding any styles in my css file, i made sure i structure the content in my HTML file. Writing my HTML first helped me to focus my attention on creating well-structured content.
    3. I started adding styles to the top of the page and work down and also i moved on to the next section once i'm satisfied with the area i finished working on.
    4. After working on the structure and design, my last work was to make my design responsive and also to have different design for different screen size using media query.

   I use HTML and CSS to build this design

  - [What I learned](#what-i-learned)
    I had to learn more about the Grid property in CSS because this property is a major fundamental factor neccessary for the birth of my design.
